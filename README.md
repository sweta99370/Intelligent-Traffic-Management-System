Intelligent Traffic Management System

Overview

The Intelligent Traffic Management System (ITMS) is a software-based traffic optimization solution designed to enhance urban mobility, reduce congestion, and prioritize emergency vehicles. It dynamically adjusts traffic signals based on real-time input from traffic police and traffic density data.

Features

Real-time Traffic Signal Control: Adjusts green light durations based on traffic density.

Emergency Vehicle Priority: Provides a clear path for ambulances, fire trucks, and police vehicles.

Manual Traffic Input: Allows traffic police to enter congestion levels and road conditions.

Automated Signal Adjustments: Optimizes traffic flow using traffic density analysis.

Threaded Execution: Uses multithreading for efficient traffic signal management.

Queue-based Emergency Handling: Ensures emergency vehicles get priority at traffic signals.

Traffic Rules & Regulations

Obey Traffic Signals: Ensures smooth vehicle movement and prevents collisions.

Follow Speed Limits: Reduces accident risks and enhances pedestrian safety.

Wear Seat Belts: Minimizes injury impact in case of accidents.

Give Way to Emergency Vehicles: Helps ambulances and other emergency responders reach their destinations quickly.

Problems with Traditional Traffic Systems

Fixed-timer signals cause unnecessary delays.

Emergency vehicles get stuck in traffic congestion.

Poor traffic management leads to high accident rates.

How It Works

Traffic police enter real-time data: Includes traffic density, roadblocks, and emergency vehicle presence.

System dynamically adjusts signals: Traffic lights change based on congestion levels.

Emergency vehicle detection: The system prioritizes emergency vehicles, providing a clear route.

Code Implementation

Technologies Used

C++ for logic and implementation.

Multithreading for managing multiple traffic signals concurrently.

Queue system for emergency vehicle priority handling.

File Structure

Intelligent Traffic Management System.cpp - Main program logic for signal control and emergency handling.

How to Run the Program

Compile the Code

g++ Intelligent_Traffic_Management_System.cpp -o itms -pthread

Run the Executable

./itms

Enter Traffic Density

Input the number of waiting vehicles for different signals.

Emergency Vehicle Detection

Press 1 when a traffic officer detects an emergency vehicle.

Press 0 to exit.

Benefits

✅ Reduces Traffic Congestion: Dynamic adjustments optimize vehicle flow.
✅ Faster Emergency Response: Emergency vehicles get priority clearance.
✅ Less Manual Effort: AI-driven automation reduces human intervention.
✅ Fewer Road Accidents: Real-time adjustments improve safety.
✅ Better Urban Mobility: Smoother traffic flow improves travel efficiency.

Conclusion

The Intelligent Traffic Management System offers an efficient, automated approach to modern traffic challenges. By incorporating real-time data input and intelligent signal control, ITMS significantly improves road safety, reduces congestion, and enhances emergency response times.
